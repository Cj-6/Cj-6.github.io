          GitHub is a web-based platform that offers a range of tools and
          features for software developers to host, review, and manage their
          code repositories. It provides collaborative functionality where
          developers can work together on projects, track changes to code, and
          contribute through pull requests and code reviews. Additionally, it
          offers features such as issue tracking, wikis, and project management
          tools. GitHub has an active community of developers who share
          knowledge, contribute to open-source projects, and participate in
          discussions on technical topics, making it an essential tool for many
          software developers and companies.

            <strong>C - Contrast:</strong> On the GitHub homepage, the use of
            color contrast is evident in the prominent blue and white color
            scheme. The use of contrasting colors helps to create a clear visual
            hierarchy, with important information, such as the "Create a
            Repository" button, standing out.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>R - Repetition:</strong> Repetition is used throughout the
            GitHub homepage to create a consistent visual style. For example,
            the use of square shapes is repeated in the buttons, icons, and
            other visual elements throughout the page, helping to create a
            cohesive design.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>A - Alignment:</strong> The GitHub homepage makes use of
            alignment to create a clear visual hierarchy and guide the user's
            attention. Elements such as the logo, navigation menu, and search
            bar are all aligned in a way that helps the user easily scan the
            page and find what they need.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>P - Proximity:</strong> Proximity is also used on the GitHub
            homepage to group related information together. For example, the
            "Explore GitHub" section groups together links to popular
            repositories, while the "Community" section groups together links to
            social media channels and other community resources. This helps
            users quickly find what they need and understand the relationships
            between different elements on the page.

          theworldsworstwebsiteever is intentionally designed to be a humorous
          example of poor web design. It features a chaotic and disorganized
          layout with terrible choice of colors, poor alignment, and confusing navigation.
          The website is intentionally difficult to use, with text placed at odd
          angles and important information hidden amongst cluttered graphics.
          While the website is an extreme example of bad design, it serves as a
          reminder of the importance of following design principles and creating
          a clear and usable interface for website users.

        <menu class="evaluation-bullets">
          <li>
            <strong>C - Contrast:</strong> The website uses a chaotic mix of
            colors that do not contrast well with each other, making it
            difficult to read the text and understand the content. There is no
            clear visual hierarchy, and important information is not given
            proper emphasis.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>R - Repetition:</strong> There is no consistent use of
            visual elements throughout the website. Each section has a different
            design and style, leading to a disjointed and confusing user
            experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>A - Alignment:</strong> he website uses poor alignment
            throughout, with elements placed literally everywhere without regard
            for creating a visual hierarchy. Text is placed in odd locations and
            at odd angles, making it difficult to read and understand.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>P - Proximity:</strong> There is no clear grouping of
            related elements on the website, making it difficult for users to
            understand the relationships between different pieces of
            information. The layout is cluttered and disorganized, with no clear
            structure or order.
