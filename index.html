            Personal Background: I'm from a town about 30 minutes from charlotte
            so I kind of grew up here. When I graduate I plan on pursuing a
            career in software engineering.
          </li>
          <li>
            Professional Background: I work at my hometown's local YMCA as a

          <li>
            Academic Background: Currently working on my Bachelor's of science
            in computer science with a concentration in software engineering,

            Background in this Subject: I don't have much experience in any sort
            of web development but I think it's really cool and I'm ready to

            <strong
              >ITIS 3135 - Web-Based Application Design and Development: </strong
            >I thought this would be a really fun class and wanted to learn
            about more front-end web development.
          </li>
          <li class="tab">
            <strong>ITSC 2175 - logic and algorithms: </strong>I honestly hate
            this class only taking it because it's required.
          </li>
          <li class="tab">
            <strong>2102 - Global Connections: </strong>This class is
            concentrated on Asia and its culture. I think this class is really
            fun and I'm enjoying it.
          </li>
          <li class="tab">
            <strong>LBST 2301 - Critical Thinking and Communication: </strong>
            This is another gen-ed I need to finish and it's about UNCC's
            connection with the charlotte area.
          </li>
          <li class="tab">
            <strong>MATH 2164 - Matrices and Linear Algebra: </strong>This is
            the last math class I have to take for my major, I think... it's
            pretty easy, I have a very cool professor, a very nice guy.
